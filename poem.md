# Living and Dying
    
   *Living for Christ, I die*; - how strange, that I,
    Thus dying, live, - and yet, thus living, die!
    Living for Christ, I die;-yet wondrous thought,
    In that same death a deathless life is wrought; - 
    Living, I die to Earth, to self, to sin; - 
    Oh, blessed death, in which such life I win!

   *Dying for Christ, I live*! - death cannot be
    A terror, then, to one from death set free'
    Living for Christ, rich blessings I attain,
    Yet, dying for Him, mine is greater gain
    Life for my Lord, is death to sin and strife,
    Yet death for Him is everlas'ing life!

   *Dying for Christ, I live*! - and yet, not I,
    But He lives in me, who did for me die.
    I die to live, - He lives to die no more,
    Who, in His death my own death-sentence bore
    "To live is Christ," if Christ within me reign,
    To die more blessed, since "to die is gain!"
